        <p>I was born in Brazil on December 7th, 2006, I'm a hobbyist game developer and currently in love with coding ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
        <p>I started coding for competitive programming when I was 13 years old, and played a little bit with Scratch a year later (and made some horrible games that I won't share :P).</p>
        <p>During the covid lockdown, I spent a lot of time working on a few small projects(mostly unfinished), and learned a lot about project developing by making Discord bots, small websites and games, while also learning some music design. <span class="small">(Please don't tell my teachers that I wasn't paying attention in class)</span></p>
        <p>In high school, I rediscovered my interest in competitive programming and learned a lot of different algorithms in <nobr>c++...</nobr> and I hated greedy and dynamic programming problems. Besides that I also participated in olympiads(not the sports one) such as Brazilian Math Olympiad(OBM) and Brazilian Informatics Olympiad(OBI) and really enjoyed participating in these events.</p>
        <p>Today, I'm graduating in Computer Science at University of S√£o Paulo and I continue to make games and some small projects while practicing competitive programming for fun.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, I like to play the violin, chess, a few mobile and pc games, making tsurus(or any origami I know how to make) and obviously hanging out with friends. I'm also interested in cooking, making pixel art, photography and playing table tennis even tho I suck at those üòî</p>
